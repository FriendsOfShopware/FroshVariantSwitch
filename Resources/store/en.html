<p>This plugin for Shopware adds functionality to change the previously selected variant of a product within basket and
    checkout views.</p><p>Available variants can be exchanged by clicking "Change variant" in cart/checkout views as
    well as in the off-canvas basket. It will open a modal that includes all relevant information. The product
    configuration as well as the quantity can be changed at this point.</p><p>Users will no longer have to remove the
    article from the basket, find the desired article again and add another variant from the article page instead.</p>
